# Definition of Done (DoD) - Aggregated Gates
- **DoD Aggregator / dod**: One gate; fails if RTM validation, RTM coverage, ADR lint, or docs link check fail; on `release/*` refs it hard-fails when LabVIEW env status vars (LV2021 x64/x86, UTF license) are not `success`; uploads DoD summary artifact.
- **PR Coverage Gate / coverage**: >=100% High/Critical RTM test presence and >=75% overall RTM test presence (tailored RTM via `.github/scripts/check_rtm_coverage.py`).
- **Traceability Gate / rtm**: Each Critical requirement has >=1 Test and Code link.
- **ADR Lint / adr-lint**: No banned phrases; decisions up to date.
- **Docs Link Check / lychee**: No broken links.
- **CM / SemVer Tag**: Release tag is `vX.Y.Z`; artifacts + notes uploaded.
- **Arch (C4/ADR)**: Minimal C4 updated; >=1 recent ADR.
## Evidence Artifacts
- `lychee/` report; DoD summary artifact; `Tooling/deployment/release_notes.md`; RTM coverage gate log; `docs/requirements/TRW_Verification_Checklist.xlsx`; `docs/requirements/rtm.csv`; `docs/testing/performance-baselines.json` (updated when performance is sampled).
## Owners
- Maintainers; Automation QA; Release Manager.

If touching High/Critical RTM items or pre-release, capture performance samples (3 runs, take median) per scenario/architecture using `Measure-Command` or the LabVIEW profiler; record entries in `docs/testing/performance-baselines.json` (see `docs/testing/templates/performance-baseline.json`).
Save measured samples for the run in `reports/performance-measurements.json` (see `docs/testing/templates/performance-measurements.json`) and portability run results in `reports/portability-status.json` (see `docs/testing/templates/portability-status.json`) so the completion report can ingest them.

(optional) run Missing-In-Project action wrapper on runner to sanity-check LV project.

CI (PR): DoD Aggregator / dod runs (RTM validation + RTM coverage + ADR Lint + Docs Link Check; on `release/*` it additionally hard-fails if LV2021 x64/x86 or UTF license status vars are not `success`); Traceability Gate / rtm runs; Coverage Gate / coverage runs; ADR Lint / adr-lint runs; Docs Link Check / lychee runs; unit tests via existing actions.

Release: merge to release-*/main -> CI (requires LV status vars = `success`); Tag and Release creates vX.Y.Z; upload artifacts (VIP, notes).

Artifacts to attach: test results (test-results.json), RTM coverage gate log (workflow), DoD summary artifact (DoD Aggregator), Tooling/deployment/release_notes.md, TRW_Verification_Checklist.xlsx, performance baselines (`docs/testing/performance-baselines.json`) when updated.

CHECKLIST (acceptance/gates)

PR Coverage Gate / coverage: `.github/scripts/check_rtm_coverage.py` shows >=100% High/Critical and >=75% overall RTM test presence (CI workflow green); Test Completion Report attached.

Docs Link Check / lychee: green.

Traceability Gate / rtm: green (all Critical reqs map to code+test).

ADR Lint / adr-lint: green (existing script).

Performance: measured scenarios within tolerance against baselines in `docs/testing/performance-baselines.json` or waiver documented by Maintainer.

CM SemVer: R1 tag vX.Y.Z; release page includes notes + artifacts.

Arch: docs/architecture/README.md updated; ADR link present.

Expected artifacts: lychee report, RTM CSV, XLSX, unit test results, RTM coverage gate log, DoD summary artifact, release notes.

EXIT CRITERIA

All gates green on PR to release/* and final tag vX.Y.Z produced; artifacts present; no broken links; RTM validated; LabVIEW env status vars = `success`; performance samples recorded or waived per baseline policy.
