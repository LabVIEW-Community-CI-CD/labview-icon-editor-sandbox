Section: 9.15 Repo CLI Probe/Build/Cache Strategy
Type/Priority: Functional/Performance | Medium
Status: Accepted
Requirement: The shared probe/build/cache helper for repo CLIs SHALL probe for the CLI binary in this order and only fall back to the next tier on failure: (1) active repo or worktree project at <repo>/Tooling/dotnet/<CLI>/<CLI>.csproj invoked via dotnet run; (2) configured source repo copy of the tooling project invoked via dotnet run; (3) existing published binary in the tooling cache; and (4) a build-and-cache step that publishes and then runs the binary from the cache.
Acceptance Criteria: Across four runs (worktree present, worktree fail with source present, cache only, empty cache), logs/provenance show probe_tier values worktree/source-repo/cache/publish respectively with matching paths; when a tier fails the next tier is attempted only after a logged failure; no unexpected tiers appear.

Acceptance Criteria: Scenario A (cache hit): existing `<CLI>/<version>/<rid>/publish/` is used, logs show cache tier, and no publish step occurs. Scenario B (cache miss then hit): first run logs publish-on-miss exactly once and creates `<CLI>/<version>/<rid>/publish/`; second run on the same key logs cache tier and does not publish; fail if publishes repeat or directories are missing.

Section: 9.15 Repo CLI Probe/Build/Cache Strategy
Type/Priority: Functional/Performance | Medium
Status: Accepted
Requirement: The repo CLI tooling cache SHALL treat <CLI>/<version>/<rid> as the provenance key for each binary, using the CLI git commit SHA or semantic version tag as <version> and the runtime identifier as <rid>, and when a caller requests a specific <CLI>/<version>/<rid> the helper SHALL validate the resolved binary against this key and fail fast with a clear error if the provenance of the binary does not match the requested tuple.
Acceptance Criteria: When a CLI is invoked with an explicit `<CLI>/<version>/<rid>` request, the helper resolves a binary whose provenance matches the requested key and either runs that binary successfully or returns a non zero exit with an error that identifies the missing or mismatched key; tampering with the cache or forcing a mismatch between the requested and resolved provenance causes the helper to fail fast rather than running an unintended binary.

Acceptance Criteria: For DevModeAgentCli, OrchestrationCli, x-cli and IntegrationEngineCli, invoking the CLI with `--print-provenance` outputs the path, `<CLI>/<version>/<rid>` key, probe tier and version or commit information in a readable form, and at least one task or workflow for each CLI records the CLI name, requested version, resolved `<rid>`, probe tier and path in its logs for every run.

Acceptance Criteria: For each supported `<rid>`, logs show four executed scenarios with explicit outcomes: (1) worktree present -> probe_tier=worktree, exit 0; (2) worktree fail + source present -> probe_tier=source-repo, exit 0; (3) cache-only -> probe_tier=cache, exit 0; (4) provenance mismatch -> probe_tier reported, exit non-zero with mismatch error.

Type/Priority: Process | High
Status: Proposed
Requirement: A repo-scoped LabVIEW Icon API source distribution shall be built solely from the repo-staged vi.lib/LabVIEW Icon API payload, the repo-staged resource folder, and Test/Unit tests for the target LabVIEW version/bitness; the build shall hard-fail if any payload is missing or its hash differs from the expected baseline; outputs shall include only that content plus manifests/zip under run-scoped builds/<run>/... and builds-isolated/<run>/... with no commit_source=repo_head entries.
Acceptance Criteria: Pass when: (a) the pre-build SHA256 of the repo-staged vi.lib/LabVIEW Icon API payload and resource folder match documented baseline hashes; (b) deleting or altering either payload causes the task to fail before manifest/zip creation; (c) generated manifests contain only entries whose relative paths start with resource/, vi.lib/LabVIEW Icon API/, or Test/Unit tests/ and every commit_source value is not repo_head; (d) artifacts exist only under builds/<run>/... and builds-isolated/<run>/... roots, with no files emitted outside those roots.

Status: Proposed
Requirement: The one-run local source distribution flow SHALL be executed via OrchestrationCli using a task graph that performs prereq check, Build_Source_Distribution.ps1, commit-index generation, checksum/hashes, and run-scoped artifact staging without relying on GitHub Actions dispatch.
Acceptance Criteria: Pass when the orchestration profile runs end-to-end on a Windows runner and produces: (a) SD zip + manifests under builds-isolated/<run>/..., (b) commit-index JSON/CSV, (c) sha256 hashes for produced artifacts; and the run fails fast if any step in the task graph fails.

Section: 9.16 LabVIEW Source Distribution
Type/Priority: Process | High
Status: Proposed
Requirement: The one-run orchestration for the source distribution SHALL coordinate concurrent use across Windows/macOS/Linux by using a run key and a cross-platform lock (file + TTL/force override) so only one local-sd task graph executes at a time and artifacts are staged under run-scoped paths.
Acceptance Criteria: Pass when: (a) lock/TTL prevents overlapping local-sd runs unless force is set; (b) run-key controls staging under builds-isolated/<runKey>/; (c) release removes the lock on success/fail. Attempting a second run while lock is fresh shall fail with a clear busy message.

Status: Proposed
Requirement: A containerized test harness SHALL be provided (Docker Desktop OK) to validate LVSD-008 by running two local-sd invocations in a Docker image and demonstrating busy/force behavior and run-key staging across Windows/macOS/Linux hosts.
Acceptance Criteria: Pass when the Docker-based harness: (a) builds/pulls the orchestration image, (b) runs one local-sd to acquire lock and stage artifacts under a run-key, (c) runs a second local-sd showing busy unless TTL expired or force enabled, and (d) stages artifacts under distinct run-key paths.
