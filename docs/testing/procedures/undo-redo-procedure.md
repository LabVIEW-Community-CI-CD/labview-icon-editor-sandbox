# Undo/Redo Core Automated Test Procedure (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 §8.4)

- Procedure ID: `PRO-AUTO-UNDO-001`
- Applicable requirements: UT-001, NF-001
- Test case specification: `docs/testing/specs/undo-redo-tcs.md`
- Executor: automation (self-hosted LabVIEW runner)

## Start Conditions
- Environment: LabVIEW 2021 on `test-2021-x64` and `test-2021-x86`; repository checked out at target commit.
- Pre-conditions: LabVIEW Unit Test Framework installed; history depth configuration at default; no lingering undo/redo state between runs.
- Data: sample action sequences generated by test VIs; log capture enabled.

## Procedure Steps (ordered)
1) Run `Test/Unit Tests/Undo Redo Core/Test Add and Undo All.vi` on x64, then x86.
2) Run `Test/Unit Tests/Undo Redo Core/Test Overflow.vi` on x64, then x86.
3) Collect `test-results.json` or equivalent output from both architectures.
4) Map observed behavior to coverage items P1–P6 in `docs/testing/specs/undo-redo-tcs.md` (empty history, single action, multi-undo/redo ordering, branch after undo, depth limit boundaries, heavy load).

## Expected Results
- All undo/redo transitions follow the model; redo stack cleared on new action; overflow trims oldest only.
- Performance-oriented overflow test completes without timeouts or stack corruption.

## Stop / Wrap-up
- Stop criteria: suite completion or first blocking defect.
- Wrap-up: archive logs and `test-results.json`; update status/completion report; attach artifacts to PR/tag run.
