# Testing Glossary

- **RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)**: Project source for requirements, priorities, verification methods, and test paths at `docs/requirements/rtm.csv`; validated and covered by CI gates.
- **TRW checklist**: Traceability and release-readiness questions maintained at `docs/requirements/TRW_Verification_Checklist.md`; referenced by the RTM coverage/validation gates.
- **DoD Aggregator**: CI workflow (`.github/workflows/dod-aggregator.yml`) that bundles RTM validation, RTM coverage, ADR lint, and Docs Link Check as a single PR gate.
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 §8 reports**: Progress and completion reports generated by CI (`reports/test-status-<run>.md` for PRs and `reports/test-completion-<tag>.md` for tagged releases) using `docs/testing/templates/test-report-template.md`.
- **Roles (Maintainer, Automation QA, Release Manager)**: Owners and approvers defined across the test policy, strategy, and plan who sign off on tailoring, coverage, and release evidence.
