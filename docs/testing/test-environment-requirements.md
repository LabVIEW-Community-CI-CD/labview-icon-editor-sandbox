# Test Environment Requirements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 §8.6, §8.8)

- Unique ID: `TEST-ENV-REQ-001`
- Owner: Automation QA
- Scope: LabVIEW Icon Editor unit tests (self-hosted) and documentation gates (Ubuntu).

## Environment Requirements
| ID | Description | Runner / Host | Version / Tooling | Severity | Verification | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ENV-GATES-UBUNTU | CI gates (RTM validation/coverage, docs lint, spec generation) must run on Ubuntu with Python 3.x | `ubuntu-latest` | Python 3.x | High | auto-check in readiness report | Automation QA | Should match DoD Aggregator runner. |
| ENV-LV-2021-X64 | LabVIEW UI + Unit Test Framework available on 64-bit Windows self-hosted runner | `self-hosted`, `test-2021-x64`, `windows` | LabVIEW 2021 + UTF license | High | env flag `LV2021_X64_STATUS` | Automation QA | Required for core Unit Tests. |
| ENV-LV-2021-X86 | LabVIEW UI + Unit Test Framework available on 32-bit Windows self-hosted runner | `self-hosted`, `test-2021-x86`, `windows` | LabVIEW 2021 + UTF license | High | env flag `LV2021_X86_STATUS` | Automation QA | Required for cross-arch coverage. |
| ENV-LICENSE-UTF | LabVIEW Unit Test Framework license present/unexpired | `self-hosted` | Valid UTF license | High | env flag `LV_UTF_LICENSE_STATUS` | Automation QA | Applies to both x64/x86 runners. |

## Readiness Process
- Readiness is reported per run in `reports/test-env-readiness-<run>.md` generated by CI (DoD Aggregator).
- Auto-checks: Ubuntu gate runner is validated automatically in the readiness script.
- Self-hosted/License checks: Mark readiness via environment variables in the workflow or repository secrets (values: `ready`, `warning`, `blocker`):
  - `LV2021_X64_STATUS`, `LV2021_X86_STATUS`, `LV_UTF_LICENSE_STATUS`
- The readiness report flags blockers; DoD Aggregator fails if any requirement is a blocker.
- Owners update this document when requirements or runner labels change.
