# Test Data Requirements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 §8.5, §8.7)

- Unique ID: `TEST-DATA-REQ-001`
- Owner: Automation QA
- Scope: LabVIEW Icon Editor unit/workflow tests and TRW workflow verification.

## Data Requirements
| ID | Purpose | Location | Owner | Retention / Refresh | Reset / Archiving | RTM coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATA-UNDO | Action sequences for undo/redo stack tests | `Test/Unit Tests/Undo Redo Core/` | Automation QA | Ephemeral per run; regenerated by unit tests | Reset by rerunning suite; logs archived in PR artifacts | UT-001, NF-001 |
| DATA-EDITORPOS | INI/coordinate fixtures for editor position tests | `Test/Unit Tests/Editor Position/` | Automation QA | Ephemeral per run; regenerated by unit tests | Reset by rerunning suite; logs/INI samples archived in PR artifacts | UT-002, NF-002 |
| DATA-TEXTICON | Text separator samples for tokenization tests | `Test/Unit Tests/Text-Based VI Icon Tests/` | Automation QA | Ephemeral per run; regenerated by unit tests | Reset by rerunning suite; logs archived in PR artifacts | TB-001, NF-003 |
| DATA-TRW | TRW checklist artifact for workflow verification | `docs/requirements/TRW_Verification_Checklist.md` | Automation QA | Persistent in repo; updated via PRs | Versioned in Git; snapshots archived in PR artifacts | TRW-001 |

## Readiness and Responsibilities
- Data custodians: Automation QA maintains fixtures and checklists; Maintainer approves changes.
- Sensitivity: No PII or secrets; fixtures are non-sensitive and version-controlled.
- Availability: Data must be present on self-hosted LabVIEW runners and in the repository. Readiness is reported per run in `reports/test-data-readiness-<run>.md` produced by CI.
