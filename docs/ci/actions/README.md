# Composite GitHub Actions

This repository defines several reusable [composite actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) in [`.github/actions`](../../../.github/actions). These actions wrap common LabVIEW build and test tasks and can be called from workflows in this or other repositories.
